<H1>Shibatch's Software Projects</H1>

<p>
This page provides free and open source software made by <a href="https://github.com/shibatch">Naoki Shibata</a>.

<H2>Actively maintained projects</H2>

<H3 id="nofreelunch"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/nofreelunch?tab=coc-ov-file" style="text-decoration: none;">Community Guidelines for Sustainability of Open-Source Ecosystem</a></H3>

<p>
To use the deliverables of open source projects is to use the public
goods of society. If you do this on a large scale, there are certain
responsibilities that come with it.
</p>

<p>
Even if you do not need a permit to fish privately in the ocean or a
lake, you still have a responsibility to protect the resources of the
fishery when you fish on a large scale.
</p>

<p>
Even if you do not need a permit to burn wood in your back yard, you
are still responsible for ensuring that you do not pollute the air
when you emit exhaust fumes on a large scale.
</p>

<p>
Open source projects are no longer just personal hobbies. Clearly,
they are now functioning as infrastructure to support society. A
responsible company is one that takes responsibility for society.
Therefore, companies that use open source projects are also
responsible for maintaining the projects. It is not the thinking of a
responsible company to say that you can do whatever you want because
the rules for doing so have not yet been established.

<H3 id="SLEEF"><a href="https://sleef.org" style="text-decoration: none;">SLEEF - SIMD Library for Evaluating Elementary Functions</a></H3>

<p>
SLEEF is a vectorized math library used in numerous leading products
and open source projects. SLEEF stands for SIMD Library for Evaluating
Elementary Functions. It implements manually vectorized versions of
all C99 real floating point math
functions. Our <a href="https://sleef.org/benchmark.xhtml">benchmarks</a>
show that the performance of SLEEF is comparable to that of the best
commercial library.
</p>

<p>
SLEEF contains not only the library of vectorized elementary
functions, but also subroutines for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
Our <a href="https://sleef.org/benchmark.xhtml#dft">benchmarks</a>
show that SLEEF DFT has performance comparable to FFTW, especially
with single threading.
</p>

<H3 id="TLFloat"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/tlfloat" style="text-decoration: none;">TLFloat - C++ template library for floating point operations</a></H3>

<p>
TLFloat is a truly constexpr C++ template library that implements
classes for operations with half, single, double, quadruple and
octuple precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers.
</p>

<p>
Internally, these classes are implemented as class templates on top of
arbitrary-precision integer class templates so that the templates are
expanded as arbitrary precision floating-point operations by just
changing the template parameters, rather than implementing each
floating-point operation for each precision. The arbitrary-precision
integer class templates are also included in this library.
</p>

<p>
<a href="tlfloat-doxygen/">Here</a> is a Doxygen-generated reference manual.

<H2>Useful tools</H2>

<h3 id="oomstaller"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/oomstaller" style="text-decoration: none;">OOMStaller - a tool for suppressing swap thrashing at build time</a></h3>

<p>
This small tool monitors the memory usage of each process when
performing a build, and suspends processes as necessary to prevent
swap thrashing. This allows you to build using all CPU cores
without worrying about swap thrashing on a Linux computer.
</p>

<p>
Please check out our <a href="https://github.com/shibatch/oomstaller">GitHub page</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="cputemp"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/cputemp" style="text-decoration: none;">CPUTemp - a tool to keep CPU below specified temperature</a></h3>

<p>
This tool monitors CPU temperature and dynamically changes the clock
frequency to keep the CPU below the specified temperature on a Linux
computer. This is basically a simple alternative to thermald, but this
tool controls the CPU temperature more aggressively than thermald.
</p>

<p>

<H3 id="octcalc"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/octcalc" style="text-decoration: none;">OctCalc - A portable octuple-precision calculator</a></H3>

<p>
This is a programmer-friendly portable calculator application that
runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It evaluates C-like mathematical
expressions and performs calculations in 256-bit floating point
numbers by utilizing
<a href="https://github.com/shibatch/tlfloat">TLFloat</a> library.
</p>

<p>
Please check out our <a href="https://github.com/shibatch/octcalc">GitHub page</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can download an Windows installer from
<a href="https://github.com/shibatch/octcalc/releases">here</a>.
</p>


<H3 id="cpuburn"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/cpuburnavx2" style="text-decoration: none;">CPUBurnAVX2</a></H3>

<p>
These tools maximize usage of the vector FMA units in the CPU with
AVX2 and AVX512 instructions to produce as much heat as possible.

<H3 id="SSRC"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/SSRC" style="text-decoration: none;">SSRC - High Quality Audio Sampling Rate Converter</a></H3>

<p>
This program converts the sampling rate of a PCM wav file. 44.1kHz sampling rate is used for a CD, and 48kHz is used for a DVD. However, converting between these frequencies is hard, because the ratio beteen these two frequencies is 147:160, which are not small numbers. Accordingly, we need a very long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response">FIR filter</a> in order not to degrade the sound quality during conversion. This program utilizes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>s to apply the FIR filter in order to reduce the amount of computation.
</p>

<p>
This program also has a function to apply dither to extend the perceived dynamic range. It is optimized for human's ear characteristics.
</p>

<p>

<H3 id="xpass"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/xpass" style="text-decoration: none;">An experimental LLVM pass</a></H3>

<p>
This is an experimental optimizing pass for LLVM, named
MathPeephole. This pass performs the following transforms.
</p>

<ul class="disc">
<li>a/b + c/d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ad + bc) / (bd)</li>
<li>x/y + z > a/b + c &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (xb - ay) / (yb) + z > c</li>
<li>a/b + c > d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b < 0 ? (a - b * (d - c) < 0) : (-(a - b * (d - c)) < 0)</li>
<li>w sqrt(x) + y > z &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w >= 0 ? ((z < y) | (wwx > (z-y)(z-y))) : ((z <= y) & (wwx < (z-y)(z-y)))</li>

<H3 id="baum"><a href="https://github.com/shibatch/baum" style="text-decoration: none;">BAUM : Software Package for Recognizing Blur-Resistant Markers</a></H3>

<p>
  Motion blur can be a problem in detecting markers when the camera or
  the object is moving. BAUM is a software library for drawing and
  recognizing circular barcodes that are designed to be relatively
  tolerant of linear motion blur. With this library, those circular
  barcodes can be recognized from video in real time from Full HD
  videos utilizing a desktop GPU.
